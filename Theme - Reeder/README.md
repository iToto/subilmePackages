Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This installation info is based on [Nil theme](https://github.com/nilium/st2-nil-theme/)'s installation info.∏

#### Installation via Git

You can download or clone the repository into your Sublime Text 2
`Packages` directory. To do this, simply navigate to
`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages` (or wherever it
is on your particular operating system) and run the following command:

	git clone git://github.com/hyspace/st2-reeder-theme.git 'Theme - Reeder'

It's **very important** you clone the repository into the `Theme - Reeder`
directory otherwise the theme won't locate its assets and will take on
an eldritch appearance. You don't want [Shub-Niggurath][shubby] crawling
out of your screen, so remember, put it in the right directory.

#### Manually Downloading

If you choose to download an archive of this repo from GitHub, you must
rename the extracted folder to `Theme - Reeder` and put it in your
`Packages` directory.  That's it -- simple.


Activating
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In your `Settings - User` file (hit ⌘, on Mac OS to open it), set the
`"theme"` key to `"Reeder.sublime-theme"`, like
so:

    {
        "theme": "Reeder.sublime-theme"
    }


Assuming you have then installed it correctly, it should show the theme.
Due to what I assume is settings from previous themes surviving, you may
wish to restart Sublime Text 2 as well, but otherwise you should be good
to go.
