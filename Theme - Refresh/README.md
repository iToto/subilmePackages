# Refresh Theme
![Refresh Theme](https://github.com/Boundincode/st2-refresh-theme/raw/master/screenshot.png)

This is my fork of Raik's Pseudo OSX Theme.  I really only changed some pngs and made the tabs more compact.
I made the theme to complement my colorscheme, also named "refresh," which can be downloaded [here](https://gist.github.com/1657493).

## Installation

For now you can download or clone it from here.

### Manually downloading
Rename the folder to `Theme - Refresh` and put it in your `Packages` directory

### Activating
In your Settings - User file:

    {
        "theme": "Refresh.sublime-theme"
    }
